# Signal-Analysis-Using-DFT-FFT
--
Analyzed the spectrum of an audio Ô¨Åle using the FFT.
Recieved a noisy corrupted signal which was recovered using DFT and sinusoidal tone analysis to determine message contained.
Simulated and plotted resulting spectrums in \textit{MATLAB}. (Report and files available on Github)
